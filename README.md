# CSS `calc()` Gotchas

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS and how to fix them. The `calc()` function is a powerful tool, but it's crucial to understand its syntax and behavior.

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Spacing:** Unnecessary spaces around operators within the `calc()` function can lead to unexpected results.
* **Operator Precedence:** The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is strictly followed. Parentheses are required for complex calculations.
* **Unit Inconsistency:** Mixing units within the calculation results in errors.

**Solutions:**

* Remove all unnecessary whitespace around operators.
* Use parentheses to force the desired order of operations.
* Ensure unit consistency throughout the calculation.

The included CSS files illustrate these common mistakes and their corrections.
